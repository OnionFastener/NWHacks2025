Ben Gay), burning sensation (Capsaicin ie. Zostrix, Theragesic, Icy-Hot), greasy residue (ie. Aspercreme, Ben-Gay), and dry skin (alcohol formulations, ie. Biofreeze).  The BioFlexor® formulation contains no alcohol, capsaicin, or methyl salicylate. Mechanism of Action:  The initial pain relief mechanism produced by the absorption of BioFlexor® generates a topical cooling effect.  This is a result of vasoconstriction of peripheral vessels in the affected areas, yielding a decreased blood flow.  This action causes a decrease in temperature of the skin and subcutaneous tissues.  As penetration continues, an interruption of sympathetic nerve conduction occurs, producing a warm vasodilation.  This in turn increases the blood flow to muscle tissues and to the surface of the skin, promoting the healing process and rendering analgesic properties.  BioFlexor® gel is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to menthol.
